[features]
# Used for inserting constants with WASM binaries (NOT paths) of the contract in
# the root crate. Usually these constants used in gclient tests instead of
# strings with paths to the binaries in the "target" directory. If you don't
# like this approach or don't use gclient tests, you can freely remove this
# feature from here and from the rest of the code.
